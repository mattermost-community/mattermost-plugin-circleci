## Development


Pull Requests are welcome! You can contact us on the [Mattermost Community ~Plugin: CircleCI channel](https://community.mattermost.com/core/channels/plugin-circleci).

This plugin only contains a server portion. Read our documentation about the [Developer Workflow](https://developers.mattermost.com/extend/plugins/developer-workflow/) and [Developer Setup](https://developers.mattermost.com/extend/plugins/developer-setup/) for more information about developing and extending plugins.

To avoid having to manually install your plugin, build and deploy your plugin using one of the following options.

### Deploying with Local Mode

If your Mattermost server is running locally, you can enable [local mode](https://docs.mattermost.com/administration/mmctl-cli-tool.html#local-mode) to streamline deploying your plugin. After configuring it, just run:

```
make deploy
```

### Deploying with credentials

Alternatively, you can authenticate with the server's API with a [personal access token](https://docs.mattermost.com/developer/personal-access-tokens.html):

```
export MM_SERVICESETTINGS_SITEURL=http://localhost:8065
export MM_ADMIN_TOKEN=j44acwd8obn78cdcx7koid4jkr
make deploy
```
