## Prerequisites 

This guide is intended for Mattermost System Admins setting up the CircleCI plugin and Mattermost users who want information about the plugin functionality.

This guide assumes you have:

* A project, hosted on github.com or bitbucket.org.
* A CircleCI SaaS account, which has access to the projects/org you want to interact with.
* Mattermost self-hosted: A Mattermost server running v5.12 or higher, with a configured Site URL. v5.24 or higher is recommended to have the autocomplete feature.
