## Manual Installation

If your server doesn't have access to the internet, you can download the latest [plugin binary release](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-plugin-circleci/releases) and upload it to your server via **System Console > Plugin Management**. The releases on this page are the same used by the Marketplace. To learn more about how to upload a plugin, see [the documentation](https://docs.mattermost.com/administration/plugins.html#plugin-uploads).
