## Prerequisites 

This guide is intended for Mattermost System Admins setting up the CircleCI plugin and Mattermost users who want information about the plugin functionality.

This guide assumes you have:

* A project, hosted on github.com or bitbucket.org.
* A CircleCI SaaS account, which has access to the projects/org you want to interact with.
* Mattermost self-hosted: A Mattermost server running v5.12 or higher, with a configured Site URL. v5.24 or higher is recommended to have the autocomplete feature.

## Installation

### Manual installation

You can download the latest [plugin binary release](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-plugin-circleci/releases) and upload it to your server via **System Console > Plugin Management**.

## Configuration

#### Step 1: Configure the bot account in Mattermost

If you have an existing Mattermost user account with the name circleci, the plugin will post using the circleci account but without a BOT tag.

To prevent this, either:

Convert the circleci user to a bot account by running `mattermost user convert circleci --bot` in the Mattermost CLI.

or

If the user is an existing user account you want to preserve, change its username and restart the Mattermost server. Once restarted, the plugin will create a bot account with the name `circleci`.

#### Step 2: Configure the plugin in Mattermost

To generate the keys needed, go to **System Console > Plugins > CircleCI**:

1. Generate a new value for **Webhooks Secret**. If the generated secret contains a forwardslash, please regenerate it.
2. Generate a new value for **At Rest Encryption Key**.
3. Select **Save**.
4. Go to **System Console > Plugins > Management** and choose **Enable** to enable the CircleCI plugin.

You're all set!

## Web Hooks

### Webhooks notifications

Subscribe a channel to notifications from a CircleCI project.

1. In the channel you want to subscribe to notifications, type `/circleci subscription add`.

  -   You can add the optional flag `--only-failed` to only receive notifications about failed jobs.
  -   You can temporarily use a project different that the one set with `/circleci default`, using the optional flag `--project <vcs/org-name/project-name>`.

2. Install the [Mattermost Plugin Notify Orb for CircleCI ](https://circleci.com/developer/orbs/orb/nathanaelhoun/mattermost-plugin-notify) in your project. You usually do this by modifying the `.circleci/config.yml`.

  -   You can add the command [status](https://circleci.com/developer/orbs/orb/nathanaelhoun/mattermost-plugin-notify#usage-status) in your existing jobs to get a notification when this job is finished.
  -   Or you can set up the [approval-notification](https://circleci.com/developer/orbs/orb/nathanaelhoun/mattermost-plugin-notify#jobs-approval-notification) job in a workflow to warn that you have a workflow waiting for approval.

3. Add the webhook URL given by `/circleci subscription` add to your CircleCI project.

  -   You may add it to the orb as a parameter, but this is discouraged as it should be treated like a secret.
  -   You should add it as a Environment Variable named `MM_WEBHOOK`, through the [CircleCI UI](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/env-vars/#setting-an-environment-variable-in-a-project) or using the plugin: `/circleci project env add MM_WEBHOOK <webhook-url>`.
