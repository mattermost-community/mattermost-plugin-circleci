## Onboarding Your Users

When you’ve tested the plugin and confirmed it’s working, notify your team so they can connect their CircleCI account to Mattermost and get started. Copy and paste the text below, edit it to suit your requirements, and send it out.

> Hi team,
> 
> We've set up the Mattermost CircleCI plugin, so you can get notifications from CircleCI in Mattermost. 
> To get started, run the `/circleci account connect` slash command from any channel within Mattermost to connect your Mattermost account with CircleCI. 
> 
> Then, take a look at the slash commands section ([link](https://mattermost.gitbook.io/circle-ci-plugin/user-guide/slash-commands) or `/circleci help`) for details about how to use the plugin.
